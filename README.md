# Lunar_Lander_Rotation_Demo
This is a demonstration program that interacts with the AdaFruit BNO055 breakout board in order to send orientation data to a host computer.The host displays a 3D model of the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) via the "Processing" application. The rotation data received from the target computer controls the rotation of the model display in real time.
